LE Student Guide 🎓
A complete, interactive support system and web guide built specifically for Lateral Entry (LE) students to navigate college life successfully. This project addresses the unique challenges faced by students who join in the second year, providing them with a comprehensive roadmap from academics to career preparation.

🌟 Why This Project Exists
Lateral Entry students often start their journey feeling overwhelmed. They miss the first year of orientation, lack foundational notes, and feel disconnected from their peers. This website was created to be the one-stop resource I wish I had, ensuring no junior ever feels lost or behind. It's more than just a website; it's a toolkit, a guide, and a motivational companion.
