                <p>
                    Welcome to the Lateral Entry Student Guide. This platform is built specially for students who join college through the lateral entry pathway. Starting in the second year is exciting but also challenging ‚Äî you skip the usual orientation, miss some 1st-year basics, and often feel like you‚Äôre ‚Äúcatching up.‚Äù
                </p>
                <p>
                    This website is here to make sure you never feel lost, never feel less, and always feel supported.
                </p>
                
                <h2>üë©‚Äçüéì My Story</h2>
                <p>
                    I am also a lateral entry student. I came into my college (IGDTUW) after completing my diploma. When I first joined, I had many doubts:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How do I catch up with what I missed in the first year?</li>
                    <li>Can I join clubs and events?</li>
                    <li>Will I be ready for placements and coding competitions?</li>
                    <li>Am I really good enough?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    At first, it felt confusing and overwhelming. But then I realized something important: <strong>We lateral entry students are not behind ‚Äî in many ways, we are ahead.</strong> We have already put in years of hard work, we know many technical subjects deeply, and we are used to handling pressure. Yes, the path is tough. But that toughness is what makes us strong.
                </p>

                <h2>üåü Why I Created This Website</h2>
                <p>
                    I built this guide because I don‚Äôt want my juniors to feel the same confusion I faced. Here, you will find everything you need to thrive. This is more than just a website. It is a support system, a motivational space, and a community where LE students can feel proud of who they are.
                </p>
